# JavaScript-Exercises

These are small exercises made in JavaScript to showcase differente abilities and skills gotten. The exercises are:

- counting-cards.js:  A small program that receives a card parameter and according to the values, will return a count to the 
user with the suggestion to Hold or Bet. Cards from 2 to 6 sum 1 to the count; cards 7 to 9 sum zero; the rest substract 1 
from count. At the end, if the result is equal or minor to zero the program will tell the user to hold, else, will suggest 
him to bet.

- Record collection.js: Given an object with several objects and data within, create a function with which you can manipulate the content of the selected objects. Complete instructions inside the document. Originally from FreeCodeCamp
